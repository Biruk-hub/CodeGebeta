## About CodeGebeta

Code Gebeta is a mobile application built with React native to help Ethiopians learn a programming language in their native language; this application contains different types of language courses, for instance, HTML, CSS, JS, React Js, and many more, since the app is for Ethiopians, the content inside this application is displayed in the local language(Amharic)
The application is still under development; because of that, not all courses are complete. Also, due to technical limitations, that app works only on android phones.<br>

## Vision

The primary objective of the CodeGebeta application is to engage new developers to learn any programming language and clarify the difficulty of understanding them by providing the content in their language.

## Version

Current version is 1.0.1 

## Instruction

How do I test on my computer? Please follow this step.

Are you new to mobile development or have never worked with ReactNative before? Then, I highly suggest you configure the ReactNative CLI development environment. You can find the instruction [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

Done !.

Now follow this step.
- clone this repository in your local machine 
- go to the root folder and open the directory in VS Code
- in VS Code, open the terminal and type ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```, (I prefer yarn install) 
- finally, run ```yarn android``` to open the application on your phone/emulator.
